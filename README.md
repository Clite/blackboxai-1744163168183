# POS System

## Project Overview
The POS System is a web-based application designed for point-of-sale transactions, providing users with a simple and effective way to manage sales, inventory, and customer interactions. This application serves as a starting point for businesses looking to streamline their sales processes and improve customer service through organized management.

## Installation
To install the POS System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up Database**:
   - Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
   - Update your database connection settings in `config/database.php` with your database server details.
   - Run the database setup script by accessing `setup_database.php` in your web browser. This will create the necessary database and tables.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your web server's document root, and place the POS System files there.
   - Access the application via your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/index.php`).

## Usage
After the installation, you can start using the POS System. The main page provides navigation to different modules. Select a module from the navigation menu to perform relevant actions related to sales or inventory management.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for managing sales and inventory.
- Database setup script to facilitate easy installation.
- Extendable architecture for additional modules and features.
- Structured navigation to improve user experience.

## Dependencies
The project does not explicitly define dependencies in a `package.json`, as it is primarily a PHP application. However, ensure you have the following installed:
- **PHP** (version compatible with your server)
- **MySQL** database server
